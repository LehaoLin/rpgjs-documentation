# RpgSprite & RpgSprite Hooks

Each time an event or player appears on the map, an `RpgSprite` is called. It contains the graphics of the player but also a container to put tiles of the map on top of the sprite (for overlay). Don't pay attention to this system, it is part of the RpgJS engine.

However, `RpgSprite` inherits from [PIXI.Sprite](https://pixijs.download/dev/docs/PIXI.Sprite.html). This way, you can add other containers, etc. This way, you can add other containers, etc.
