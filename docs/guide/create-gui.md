# Create Graphical User Interface (GUI)

## Prerequisites

1. You must be familiar with the VueJS 3 framework

## It is necessary to know

1. Each user interface uses the DOM and not HTML5 Canvas. Why not? Because it is easier to create interfaces with components than with canvas graphics.
2. Each GUI has an identifier. Predefined identifiers exist to manage existing GUI (dialog, main menu, shop, etc.).
