# Save the player's progress

## It is necessary to know

- The goal is to save the player's status and put the data in the database of your choice (SQL, NoSQL, LocalStorage (for browser), etc.).

## Example 

Two methods will be necessary:

* [player.load(json)](/commands/common.html#load-progress)
* [player.save()](/commands/common.html#save-progress)

You decide when you want to save the player's game.
