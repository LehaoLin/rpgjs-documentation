# Save the player's progress

## It is necessary to know

- The goal is to save the player's status and put the data in the database of your choice (SQL, NoSQL, LocalStorage (for browser), etc.).

## Example 

Two methods will be necessary:

* [player.load(json)](/commands/common.html#load-progress)
* [player.save()](/commands/common.html#save-progress)

## Screens

You decide when you want to save the player's game.

If you want screens to save or load a game, use the following plugins:
- [Plugin Save Screen (for RPG)](/plugins/save.html)
- [Plugin Title Screen (with load screen or login)](/plugins/title-screen.html)
